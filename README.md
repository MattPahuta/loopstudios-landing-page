## Acknowledgments

- [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/) - I completed this challenge after working through Brad Traversy's excellent [Tailwind from Scratch](https://tailwindfromscratch.com/) course, making some additional alterations along the way, particularly with the desktop/mobile navigation and semantic HTML. But Brad's course is excellent and provides everything you need to know to become proficient with Tailwind.
